# Bayesian-conditional-independence-simulation-
Simulation study in R on Bayesian conditional independence tests in 2x2x2 contingency tables using different (g-)prior variants. 

The Bayes factors are computed using the R Package BAS (Bayesian Variable Selection and Model Averaging using Bayesian Adaptive Sampling).

The figure below gives an overview of how the simulation process works.
